# src/

Application source code root. Subfolders implement the various domains, such as UI, graphing, search, data_access, domain models, projects, and notes. This folder should be treated as the home for the app code for a selected toolkit (Qt/.NET/etc.).

See `Rebuild_Architecture.md` at the project root for a detailed proposed layout and required responsibilities per folder.
