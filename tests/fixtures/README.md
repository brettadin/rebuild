# Fixture directory

This folder should contain real dataset samples (no synthetic data) used for unit and integration tests. Each fixture must be accompanied by a reference file in `docs/references/` with provenance details and a URL/DOI.

Example file layout:
- `real_nist_subset.txt` — a small sample of NIST line list (include provenance in `docs/references/`)
