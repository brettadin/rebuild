# Phase 0 — Foundation & Skeleton

Goal: A minimal desktop app that launches on Windows/macOS with the repository layout in place.

What we implement in Phase 0:
- A minimal desktop main window (blank shell) that opens on supported platforms.
- Simple menu/toolbar placeholders.
- Logging and configuration wiring.
- A trivial test harness that can run a smoke test (app imports and main window class exists).

DO NOT implement import/graph/search/notes features in Phase 0; keep the app as a shell only.
