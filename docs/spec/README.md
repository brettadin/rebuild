# Spec Documents

This folder gives pointers to the core project specifications: 

- `../../Rebuild.md` — Primary app specification (features, rules, sources)
- `../../Rebuild_Architecture.md` — Proposed repository and code architecture

These two files are the canonical source-of-truth for the project and should be the first place any agent or developer looks before implementing a feature.
